# ShadowSharedHealthMod
Shared Health Mod, with a few more features, for Minecraft 1.16.5. Install on forge server, no clientside mods needed to connect. For best experience, play with no natural regeneration (UHC).    
# Features
Shared Health Bar between all online players  
Potion effects are shared (example: One person gets hunger then all players will be given hunger effect. This can make wither and poison dangerous because the damage will compound between all online players and conversely regen is buffed in the same way)  
If average distance between all players is above 25 blocks, everyone begins to take damage
If two players with each more than 17 hunger are within 10 blocks, all players will slowly heal
